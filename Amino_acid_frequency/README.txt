This repository includes a program to calculate and create a graph of the amino acid frequency in each position in proteins.

Fill the appropriate path of each program before using.
You need a metadata and FASTA format files of viruses obtained from GISAID to run the first program (1_Create_FASTA_file.py).
The second file, 2_sequence_alignment.py, will align the FASTA file.
The third file, 3_count_frequency.py, will give the outputs of a CSV file including the number of amino acids in each position and a CSV file including the position and the amino acid where the most frequent amino acid is different.
The fourth file, 4_make_graph_data.py, will calculate the amino acid frequency of the specific position and create a graph.

Thank you for visiting this repository.
